Hi all! Welcome to my homepage.

I am currently a research assistant in [the Department of Statistics](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/) under the supervision of [Professor Hoi Ying Wong](https://www.sta.cuhk.edu.hk/peoples/hywong/). While my interests are diverse, I am fascinated by statistical machine learning in financial trading. I am currently working on the interpretations and evaluations of classical black-box models.

I was born and raised in Shanxi Province, China Mainland, where my parents and relatives still live. I received my bachelor's degree in Statistics from CUHK in 2021.

My resumé is availiable [here](https://qcongdoris.github.io//resume/).
One can approach me through the contact details [here](https://qcongdoris.github.io//contact/).
